# React Todo App with Redux

1. Connect the Redux store to your App (Hint: changes should happen in the index.js file)

1. Test that adding and listing todo items work. If so let's add the delete functionality.

1. Create a new action called deleteItem

1. Create a new reducer for deleteItem

1. In the TodoItems connect() call map the new deleteItem action to props (Hint: changes should be in components/TodoItems/index.js)

1. In the TodoItems component you need to wire up the new deleteItem coming from the newly redux mapped action (from props thanks to the connect() call)
